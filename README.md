## Live demo:

This is a front-end web application developed as my first personal project while studying at General
Assembly.

<a id="description"></a>
## Project Description:

Trivia is a type of game in which players are asked questions about different topics and they have to get as many correct answers as possible. Trivia contests are usually organized as part of events, parties and as pub entertainment. Normally contestants are organized in teams and the team who gets the higher score wins.

## Benefits of playing trivia and quiz games:

Unfortunately every year we grow a bit older and we realize that our mind is not as sharp and fast as it used to be. If we donâ€™t train our brain, it gets harder for us to remember, concentrate and learn new skills and information.
Quiz questions can help prevent this process to go so fast as it serves as a form of exercise for our brain.
